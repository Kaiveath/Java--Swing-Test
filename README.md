# Java--Swing-Test + some of data base
Sample app for small buissnes with some data base in SQL; 

  This is my first Java App, thats why its so chaotic ;)
If you wanna RUN this app please start from Login.java - user name is: 2 and password is: 2
If you cant log in, just start form HOME.java.
Im not sure right now about data base - its on my PC or its in some java file. (This project is FROZZEN about half year).
